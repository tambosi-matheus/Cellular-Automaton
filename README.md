<h3>Target platform: Unity - PC</h3>
<h6>Technologies: Unity, C#, HLSL, multithreading</h6>
I've been passioned about automation, systems and AI since my first Boid code in 2020, when I learned about compute shade and the possibility to use GPU's multithreading power for physics simulations I jumped right into it. This approach let agents go from a max of 1000 using GameObjects to more than a million. Here are some examples of results I filmed when implementing Stigmergy and Conway's Game of Life rules.

<br></br>

<h5>The Rules</h5>

Stigmergy - Agents wander around leaving a trail that decay and diffuse over time. Agents will steer towards trails

Game of Life - Cells life or die based on the quantity of live cells adjacent to them

<small>This explanations are extremely superficial, if you're interested in this topics I suggest reading related papers</small>
